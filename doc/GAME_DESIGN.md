## Sound Design

### Music

The game is rather boring all by itself. The music should encourage and motivate the player to
make profit and explore trading opportunities. General feelings:

- Uplifting
- Driving
- Maybe a little bit epic

Following Music needs to be done:

- Main Theme of the game, like an epic intro for the game in the main menu.
- An encouraging background music loop for the main system map you fly in.
  - Ideally should every system have it's own music, to present the player with
    more difference per system. But for now even one track is more than nothing!
- Background ambient noise for a space station. For the time you are docked to a station.
  Ideas for the contents:
  - computers beeping
  - background hum or noise
  - sounds of people talking (like a market)

### Sounds

#### UI

The UI needs a few sounds:

- An "accept" sound, when clicking on a button
- A "cancel" or "denied" sound, when clicking a button with no effect
- An "alert" sound when colliding with a station


#### Game
- A "mining" sound when the ship is mining at an asteroid
- A "main engine" sound that plays when main engine is fired
- A "decelerating engine" sound that plays when the deceleration engine fires (optional)
- A "thrusters" sound that plays when thrusters are fired.
