    I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
    of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
    is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
    well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
    graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
    my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
    or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
    fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
    near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
    discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
    be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
    Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.

    Withdraws



    Come, shall we hear this music?


    Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
    As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!


    See you where Benedick hath hid himself?


    O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
    We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.



    Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.


    O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
    To slander music any more than once.


    It is the witness still of excellency
    To put a strange face on his own perfection.
    I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.


    Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
    Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
    To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
    Yet will he swear he loves.


    Now, pray thee, come;
    Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
    Do it in notes.


    Note this before my notes;
    There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.


    Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
    Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.

    Air


    Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
    not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
    of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
    all's done.

    The Song


    Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
    Men were deceivers ever,
    One foot in sea and one on shore,
    To one thing constant never:
    Then sigh not so, but let them go,
    And be you blithe and bonny,
    Converting all your sounds of woe
    Into Hey nonny, nonny.
    Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
    Of dumps so dull and heavy;
    The fraud of men was ever so,
    Since summer first was leafy:
    Then sigh not so, & c.


    By my troth, a good song.


    And an ill singer, my lord.


    Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.


    An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
    they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
    voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
    night-raven, come what plague could have come after
    it.


    Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
    get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
    would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.


    The best I can, my lord.


    Do so: farewell.

     BALTHASAR

    Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
    to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
    Signior Benedick?


    O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
    never think that lady would have loved any man.


    No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
    should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
    all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.


    Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?


    By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
    of it but that she loves him with an enraged
    affection: it is past the infinite of thought.


    May be she doth but counterfeit.


    Faith, like enough.


    O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
    passion came so near the life of passion as she
    discovers it.


    Why, what effects of passion shows she?


    Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.


    What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
    my daughter tell you how.


    She did, indeed.


    How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
    thought her spirit had been invincible against all
    assaults of affection.


    I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
    against Benedick.


    I should think this a gull, but that the
    white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
    sure, hide himself in such reverence.


    He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.


    Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?


    No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.


    'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
    I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
    with scorn, write to him that I love him?'


    This says she now when she is beginning to write to
    him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
    there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
    sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.


    Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
    pretty jest your daughter told us of.


    O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
    found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?


    That.


    O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
    railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
    to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
    measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
    should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
    love him, I should.'


    Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
    beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
    sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'


    She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
    ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
    is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
    to herself: it is very true.


    It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
    other, if she will not discover it.


    To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
    torment the poor lady worse.


    An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
    excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
    she is virtuous.


    And she is exceeding wise.


    In every thing but in loving Benedick.


    O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
    a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
    the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
    cause, being her uncle and her guardian.


    I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
    have daffed all other respects and made her half
    myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
    what a' will say.


    Were it good, think you?


    Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
    will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
    she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
    her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
    accustomed crossness.


    She doth well: if she should make tender of her
    love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
    man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.


    He is a very proper man.


    He hath indeed a good outward happiness.


    Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.


    He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.


    And I take him to be valiant.


    As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
    quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
    avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
    them with a most Christian-like fear.


    If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
    if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
    quarrel with fear and trembling.


    And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
    howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
    he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
    we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?


    Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
    good counsel.


    Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.


    Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
    let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
    could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
    how much he is unworthy so good a lady.


    My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.


    If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
    trust my expectation.


    Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
    must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
    sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
    another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
    scene that I would see, which will be merely a
    dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

    Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO


    [Coming forward] This can be no trick: the
    conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
    this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
    seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
    why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
    they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
    the love come from her; they say too that she will
    rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
    never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
    are they that hear their detractions and can put
    them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
    truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
    so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
    me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
    no great argument of her folly, for I will be
    horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
    odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
    because I have railed so long against marriage: but
    doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
    in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
    Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
    the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
    No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
    die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
    were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
    she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
    her.



    Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.


    Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.


    I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
    pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
    not have come.


    You take pleasure then in the message?


    Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
    point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
    signior: fare you well.

    


    Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
    to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
    no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
    to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
    that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
    not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
    love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

    




    Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
    There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
    Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
    Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
    Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
    Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
    And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
    Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
    Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
    Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
    Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
    To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
    Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.


    I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

    


    Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
    As we do trace this alley up and down,
    Our talk must only be of Benedick.
    When I do name him, let it be thy part
    To praise him more than ever man did merit:
    My talk to thee must be how Benedick
    Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
    Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
    That only wounds by hearsay.


    Now begin;
    For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
    Close by the ground, to hear our conference.


    The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
    Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
    And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
    So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
    Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
    Fear you not my part of the dialogue.


    Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
    Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.

    Approaching the bower

    No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
    I know her spirits are as coy and wild
    As haggerds of the rock.


    But are you sure
    That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?


    So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.


    And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?


    They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
    But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
    To wish him wrestle with affection,
    And never to let Beatrice know of it.


    Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
    Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
    As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?


    O god of love! I know he doth deserve
    As much as may be yielded to a man:
    But Nature never framed a woman's heart
    Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
    Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
    Misprising what they look on, and her wit
    Values itself so highly that to her
    All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
    Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
    She is so self-endeared.


    Sure, I think so;
    And therefore certainly it were not good
    She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.


    Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
    How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
    But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
    She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
    If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
    Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
    If low, an agate very vilely cut;
    If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
    If silent, why, a block moved with none.
    So turns she every man the wrong side out
    And never gives to truth and virtue that
    Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.


    Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.


    No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
    As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
    But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
    She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
    Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
    Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
    Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
    It were a better death than die with mocks,
    Which is as bad as die with tickling.


    Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.


    No; rather I will go to Benedick
    And counsel him to fight against his passion.
    And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
    To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
    How much an ill word may empoison liking.


    O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
    She cannot be so much without true judgment--
    Having so swift and excellent a wit
    As she is prized to have--as to refuse
    So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.


    He is the only man of Italy.
    Always excepted my dear Claudio.


    I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
    Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
    For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
    Goes foremost in report through Italy.


    Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.


    His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
    When are you married, madam?


    Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
    I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
    Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.


    She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.


    If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
    Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

    Exeunt HERO and URSULA


    [Coming forward]
    What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
    Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
    Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
    No glory lives behind the back of such.
    And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
    Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
    If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
    To bind our loves up in a holy band;
    For others say thou dost deserve, and I
    Believe it better than reportingly.

    




    I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
    then go I toward Arragon.


    I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
    vouchsafe me.


    Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
    of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
    and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
    with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
    of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
    mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
    bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
    him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
    tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
    tongue speaks.


    Gallants, I am not as I have been.


    So say I	methinks you are sadder.


    I hope he be in love.


    Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
    him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
    he wants money.


    I have the toothache.


    Draw it.


    Hang it!


    You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.


    What! sigh for the toothache?


    Where is but a humour or a worm.


    Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
    it.


    Yet say I, he is in love.


    There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
    a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
    a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
    shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
    the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
    the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
    to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
    fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.


    If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
    believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
    mornings; what should that bode?


    Hath any man seen him at the barber's?


    No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
    and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
    stuffed tennis-balls.


    Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.


    Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
    out by that?


    That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.


    The greatest note of it is his melancholy.


    And when was he wont to wash his face?


    Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
    what they say of him.


    Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
    a lute-string and now governed by stops.


    Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
    conclude he is in love.


    Nay, but I know who loves him.


    That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.


    Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
    all, dies for him.


    She shall be buried with her face upwards.


    Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
    signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
    or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
    hobby-horses must not hear.

    Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO


    For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.


    'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
    played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
    bears will not bite one another when they meet.



    My lord and brother, God save you!


    Good den, brother.


    If your leisure served, I would speak with you.


    In private?


    If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
    what I would speak of concerns him.


    What's the matter?


    [To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be married
    to-morrow?


    You know he does.


    I know not that, when he knows what I know.


    If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.


    You may think I love you not: let that appear
    hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
    manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
    well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
    your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
    labour ill bestowed.


    Why, what's the matter?


    I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
    shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
    the lady is disloyal.


    Who, Hero?


    Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:


    Disloyal?


    The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
    could say she were worse: think you of a worse
    title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
    further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
    see her chamber-window entered, even the night
    before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
    to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
    to change your mind.


    May this be so?


    I will not think it.


    If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
    that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
    you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
    more, proceed accordingly.


    If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
    her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
    wed, there will I shame her.


    And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
    with thee to disgrace her.


    I will disparage her no farther till you are my
    witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
    let the issue show itself.


    O day untowardly turned!


    O mischief strangely thwarting!


    O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
    you have seen the sequel.

    Exeunt




    Are you good men and true?


    Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
    salvation, body and soul.


    Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
    they should have any allegiance in them, being
    chosen for the prince's watch.


    Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.


    First, who think you the most desertless man to be
    constable?


    Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
    write and read.


    Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
    you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
    the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.


    Both which, master constable,--


    You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
    for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
    no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
    let that appear when there is no need of such
    vanity. You are thought here to be the most
    senseless and fit man for the constable of the
    watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
    charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
    to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.


    How if a' will not stand?


    Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
    presently call the rest of the watch together and
    thank God you are rid of a knave.


    If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
    of the prince's subjects.


    True, and they are to meddle with none but the
    prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
    the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
    talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.


    We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
    belongs to a watch.


    Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
    watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
    offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
    stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
    ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.


    How if they will not?


    Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
    they make you not then the better answer, you may
    say they are not the men you took them for.


    Well, sir.


    If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
    of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
    kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
    why the more is for your honesty.


    If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
    hands on him?


    Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
    that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
    way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
    show himself what he is and steal out of your company.


    You have been always called a merciful man, partner.


    Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
    a man who hath any honesty in him.


    If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
    to the nurse and bid her still it.


    How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?


    Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
    her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
    lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.


    'Tis very true.


    This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
    to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
    prince in the night, you may stay him.


    Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.


    Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
    the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
    the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
    to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
    man against his will.


    By'r lady, I think it be so.


    Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
    any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
    fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
    Come, neighbour.


    Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
    upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.


    One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
    about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
    there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
    Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

    Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES



    What Conrade!


    [Aside] Peace! stir not.


    Conrade, I say!


    Here, man; I am at thy elbow.


    Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
    scab follow.


    I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
    with thy tale.


    Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
    it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
    utter all to thee.


    [Aside] Some treason, masters: yet stand close.


    Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.


    Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?


    Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
    villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
    have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
    price they will.


    I wonder at it.


    That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
    the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
    nothing to a man.


    Yes, it is apparel.


    I mean, the fashion.


    Yes, the fashion is the fashion.


    Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
    seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
    is?


    [Aside] I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
    thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
    gentleman: I remember his name.


    Didst thou not hear somebody?


    No; 'twas the vane on the house.


    Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
    fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
    bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
    sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
    in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
    priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
    shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
    where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?


    All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
    out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
    thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
    shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?


    Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
    wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
    name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
    chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
    night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
    tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
    planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
    John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.


    And thought they Margaret was Hero?


    Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
    devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
    by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
    the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
    by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
    Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
    he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
    at the temple, and there, before the whole
    congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
    and send her home again without a husband.


    We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!


    Call up the right master constable. We have here
    recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
    ever was known in the commonwealth.


    And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
    wears a lock.


    Masters, masters,--


    You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.


    Masters,--


    Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.


    We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
    up of these men's bills.


    A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.

    Exeunt




    Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
    her to rise.


    I will, lady.


    And bid her come hither.


    Well.

    


    Troth, I think your other rabato were better.


    No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.


    By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
    cousin will say so.


    My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
    none but this.


    I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
    were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
    fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
    gown that they praise so.


    O, that exceeds, they say.


    By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
    yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
    silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
    and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
    but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
    fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.


    God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
    exceeding heavy.


    'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.


    Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?


    Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
    marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
    honourable without marriage? I think you would have
    me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
    thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
    nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
    husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
    and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
    heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.



    Good morrow, coz.


    Good morrow, sweet Hero.


    Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?


    I am out of all other tune, methinks.


    Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
    burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.


    Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
    husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
    lack no barns.


    O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.


    'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
    ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!


    For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?


    For the letter that begins them all, H.


    Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
    sailing by the star.


    What means the fool, trow?


    Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!


    These gloves the count sent me; they are an
    excellent perfume.


    I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.


    A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.


    O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
    professed apprehension?


    Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?


    It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
    cap. By my troth, I am sick.


    Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
    and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.


    There thou prickest her with a thistle.


    Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
    this Benedictus.


    Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
    meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
    that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
    not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
    not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
    if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
    are in love or that you will be in love or that you
    can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
    now is he become a man: he swore he would never
    marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
    his meat without grudging: and how you may be
    converted I know not, but methinks you look with
    your eyes as other women do.


    What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?


    Not a false gallop.

    Re-enter URSULA


    Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
    Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
    town, are come to fetch you to church.


    Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.

    Exeunt




    What would you with me, honest neighbour?


    Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
    that decerns you nearly.


    Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.


    Marry, this it is, sir.


    Yes, in truth it is, sir.


    What is it, my good friends?


    Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
    matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
    blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
    in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.


    Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
    that is an old man and no honester than I.


    Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.


    Neighbours, you are tedious.


    It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
    poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
    if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
    my heart to bestow it all of your worship.


    All thy tediousness on me, ah?


    Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
    I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
    man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
    am glad to hear it.


    And so am I.


    I would fain know what you have to say.


    Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
    worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
    knaves as any in Messina.


    A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
    say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
    us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
    neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
    ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
    soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
    broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
    are not alike; alas, good neighbour!


    Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.


    Gifts that God gives.


    I must leave you.


    One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
    comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
    have them this morning examined before your worship.


    Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
    am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.


    It shall be suffigance.


    Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.



    My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
    her husband.


    I'll wait upon them: I am ready.

    Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger


    Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
    bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
    are now to examination these men.


    And we must do it wisely.


    We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
    that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
    get the learned writer to set down our
    excommunication and meet me at the gaol.

    Exeunt




    Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
    form of marriage, and you shall recount their
    particular duties afterwards.


    You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.


    No.


    To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.


    Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.


    I do.


    If either of you know any inward impediment why you
    should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
    to utter it.


    Know you any, Hero?


    None, my lord.


    Know you any, count?


    I dare make his answer, none.


    O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
    do, not knowing what they do!


    How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
    laughing, as, ah, ha, he!


    Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
    Will you with free and unconstrained soul
    Give me this maid, your daughter?


    As freely, son, as God did give her me.


    And what have I to give you back, whose worth
    May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?


    Nothing, unless you render her again.


    Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
    There, Leonato, take her back again:
    Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
    She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
    Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
    O, what authority and show of truth
    Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
    Comes not that blood as modest evidence
    To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
    All you that see her, that she were a maid,
    By these exterior shows? But she is none:
    She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
    Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.


    What do you mean, my lord?


    Not to be married,
    Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.


    Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
    Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
    And made defeat of her virginity,--


    I know what you would say: if I have known her,
    You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
    And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
    No, Leonato,
    I never tempted her with word too large;
    But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
    Bashful sincerity and comely love.


    And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?


    Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
    You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
    As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
    But you are more intemperate in your blood
    Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
    That rage in savage sensuality.


    Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?


    Sweet prince, why speak not you?


    What should I speak?
    I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
    To link my dear friend to a common stale.


    Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?


    Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.


    This looks not like a nuptial.


    True! O God!


    Leonato, stand I here?
    Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
    Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?


    All this is so: but what of this, my lord?


    Let me but move one question to your daughter;
    And, by that fatherly and kindly power
    That you have in her, bid her answer truly.


    I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.


    O, God defend me! how am I beset!
    What kind of catechising call you this?


    To make you answer truly to your name.


    Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
    With any just reproach?


    Marry, that can Hero;
    Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
    What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
    Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
    Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.


    I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.


    Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
    I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
    Myself, my brother and this grieved count
    Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
    Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
    Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
    Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
    A thousand times in secret.


    Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
    Not to be spoke of;
    There is not chastity enough in language
    Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
    I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.


    O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
    If half thy outward graces had been placed
    About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
    But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
    Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
    For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
    And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
    To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
    And never shall it more be gracious.


    Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?

    HERO swoons


    Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?


    Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
    Smother her spirits up.

    Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO


    How doth the lady?


    Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
    Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!


    O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
    Death is the fairest cover for her shame
    That may be wish'd for.


    How now, cousin Hero!


    Have comfort, lady.


    Dost thou look up?


    Yea, wherefore should she not?


    Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
    Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
    The story that is printed in her blood?
    Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
    For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
    Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
    Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
    Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
    Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
    O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
    Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
    Why had I not with charitable hand
    Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
    Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
    I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
    This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
    But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
    And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
    That I myself was to myself not mine,
    Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
    Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
    Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
    And salt too little which may season give
    To her foul-tainted flesh!


    Sir, sir, be patient.
    For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
    I know not what to say.


    O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!


    Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?


    No, truly not; although, until last night,
    I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.


    Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
    Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
    Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
    Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
    Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.


    Hear me a little;
    For I have only been silent so long
    And given way unto this course of fortune.
    ...
    By noting of the lady I have mark'd
    A thousand blushing apparitions
    To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
    In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
    And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
    To burn the errors that these princes hold
    Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
    Trust not my reading nor my observations,
    Which with experimental seal doth warrant
    The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
    My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
    If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
    Under some biting error.


    Friar, it cannot be.
    Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
    Is that she will not add to her damnation
    A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
    Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
    That which appears in proper nakedness?


    Lady, what man is he you are accused of?


    They know that do accuse me; I know none:
    If I know more of any man alive
    Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
    Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
    Prove you that any man with me conversed
    At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
    Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
    Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!


    There is some strange misprision in the princes.


    Two of them have the very bent of honour;
    And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
    The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
    Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.


    I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
    These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
    The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
    Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
    Nor age so eat up my invention,
    Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
    Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
    But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
    Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
    Ability in means and choice of friends,
    To quit me of them throughly.


    Pause awhile,
    And let my counsel sway you in this case.
    Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
    Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
    And publish it that she is dead indeed;
    Maintain a mourning ostentation
    And on your family's old monument
    Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
    That appertain unto a burial.


    What shall become of this? what will this do?


    Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
    Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
    But not for that dream I on this strange course,
    But on this travail look for greater birth.
    She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
    Upon the instant that she was accused,
    Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
    Of every hearer: for it so falls out
    That what we have we prize not to the worth
    Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
    Why, then we rack the value, then we find
    The virtue that possession would not show us
    Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
    When he shall hear she died upon his words,
    The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
    Into his study of imagination,
    And every lovely organ of her life
    Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
    More moving-delicate and full of life,
    Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
    Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
    If ever love had interest in his liver,
    And wish he had not so accused her,
    No, though he thought his accusation true.
    Let this be so, and doubt not but success
    Will fashion the event in better shape
    Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
    But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
    The supposition of the lady's death
    Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
    And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
    As best befits her wounded reputation,
    In some reclusive and religious life,
    Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.


    Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
    And though you know my inwardness and love
    Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
    Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
    As secretly and justly as your soul
    Should with your body.


    Being that I flow in grief,
    The smallest twine may lead me.


    'Tis well consented: presently away;
    For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
    Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
    Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

    Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE


    Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?


    Yea, and I will weep a while longer.


    I will not desire that.


    You have no reason; I do it freely.


    Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.


    Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!


    Is there any way to show such friendship?


    A very even way, but no such friend.


    May a man do it?


    It is a man's office, but not yours.


    I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
    not that strange?


    As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
    possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
    you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
    confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.


    By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.


    Do not swear, and eat it.


    I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
    him eat it that says I love not you.


    Will you not eat your word?


    With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
    I love thee.


    Why, then, God forgive me!


    What offence, sweet Beatrice?


    You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
    protest I loved you.


    And do it with all thy heart.


    I love you with so much of my heart that none is
    left to protest.


    Come, bid me do any thing for thee.


    Kill Claudio.


    Ha! not for the wide world.


    You kill me to deny it. Farewell.


    Tarry, sweet Beatrice.


    I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
    you: nay, I pray you, let me go.


    Beatrice,--


    In faith, I will go.


    We'll be friends first.


    You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.


    Is Claudio thine enemy?


    Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
    hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
    that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
    come to take hands; and then, with public
    accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
    --O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
    in the market-place.


    Hear me, Beatrice,--


    Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!


    Nay, but, Beatrice,--


    Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.


    Beat--


    Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
    a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
    surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
    had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
    manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
    compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
    trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
    that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
    man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.


    Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.


    Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.


    Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?


    Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.


    Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
    kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
    Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
    hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
    cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.

    Exeunt




    Is our whole dissembly appeared?


    O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.


    Which be the malefactors?


    Marry, that am I and my partner.


    Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.


    But which are the offenders that are to be
    examined? let them come before master constable.


    Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
    name, friend?


    Borachio.


    Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?


    I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.


    Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
    you serve God?


    Yea, sir, we hope.


    Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
    write God first; for God defend but God should go
    before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
    that you are little better than false knaves; and it
    will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
    you for yourselves?


    Marry, sir, we say we are none.


    A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
    will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
    word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
    you are false knaves.


    Sir, I say to you we are none.


    Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
    tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?


    Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
    you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.


    Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
    come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
    name, accuse these men.


    This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
    brother, was a villain.


    Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
    perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.


    Master constable,--


    Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
    I promise thee.


    What heard you him say else?


    Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
    Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.


    Flat burglary as ever was committed.


    Yea, by mass, that it is.


    What else, fellow?


    And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
    disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.


    O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
    redemption for this.


    What else?


    This is all.


    And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
    Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
    Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
    refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
    Master constable, let these men be bound, and
    brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
    him their examination.

    


    Come, let them be opinioned.


    Let them be in the hands--


    Off, coxcomb!


    God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
    down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
    Thou naughty varlet!


    Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.


    Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
    suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
    down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
    ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
    that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
    piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
    I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
    and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
    more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
    Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
    rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
    had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
    thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
    I had been writ down an ass!

    Exeunt




    If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
    And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
    Against yourself.


    I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
    Which falls into mine ears as profitless
    As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
    Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
    But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
    Bring me a father that so loved his child,
    Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
    And bid him speak of patience;
    Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
    And let it answer every strain for strain,
    As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
    In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
    If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
    Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
    Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
    With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
    And I of him will gather patience.
    But there is no such man: for, brother, men
    Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
    Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
    Their counsel turns to passion, which before
    Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
    Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
    Charm ache with air and agony with words:
    No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
    To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
    But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
    To be so moral when he shall endure
    The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
    My griefs cry louder than advertisement.


    Therein do men from children nothing differ.


    I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
    For there was never yet philosopher
    That could endure the toothache patiently,
    However they have writ the style of gods
    And made a push at chance and sufferance.


    Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
    Make those that do offend you suffer too.


    There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
    My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
    And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
    And all of them that thus dishonour her.


    Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.



    Good den, good den.


    Good day to both of you.


    Hear you. my lords,--


    We have some haste, Leonato.


    Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
    Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.


    Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.


    If he could right himself with quarreling,
    Some of us would lie low.


    Who wrongs him?


    Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
    Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
    I fear thee not.


    Marry, beshrew my hand,
    If it should give your age such cause of fear:
    In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.


    Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
    I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
    As under privilege of age to brag
    What I have done being young, or what would do
    Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
    Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
    That I am forced to lay my reverence by
    And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
    Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
    I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
    Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
    And she lies buried with her ancestors;
    O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
    Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!


    My villany?


    Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.


    You say not right, old man.


    My lord, my lord,
    I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
    Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
    His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.


    Away! I will not have to do with you.


    Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
    If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.


    He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
    But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
    Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
    Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
    Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
    Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.


    Brother,--


    Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
    And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
    That dare as well answer a man indeed
    As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
    Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!


    Brother Antony,--


    Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
    And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
    Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
    That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
    Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
    And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
    How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
    And this is all.


    But, brother Antony,--


    Come, 'tis no matter:
    Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.


    Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
    My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
    But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
    But what was true and very full of proof.


    My lord, my lord,--


    I will not hear you.


    No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.


    And shall, or some of us will smart for it.

    Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO


    See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.



    Now, signior, what news?


    Good day, my lord.


    Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
    almost a fray.


    We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
    with two old men without teeth.


    Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
    we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.


    In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
    to seek you both.


    We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
    high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
    away. Wilt thou use thy wit?


    It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?


    Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?


    Never any did so, though very many have been beside
    their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
    minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.


    As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
    sick, or angry?


    What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
    thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.


    Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
    charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.


    Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
    broke cross.


    By this light, he changes more and more: I think
    he be angry indeed.


    If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.


    Shall I speak a word in your ear?


    God bless me from a challenge!


    [Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:
    I will make it good how you dare, with what you
    dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
    protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
    lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
    hear from you.


    Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.


    What, a feast, a feast?


    I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
    head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
    curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
    a woodcock too?


    Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.


    I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
    other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
    said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
    great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
    'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
    hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
    is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
    'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
    believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
    Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
    there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
    did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
    virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
    wast the properest man in Italy.


    For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
    not.


    Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
    did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
    the old man's daughter told us all.


    All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
    hid in the garden.


    But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
    the sensible Benedick's head?


    Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
    married man'?


    Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
    you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
    as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
    hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
    you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
    the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
    you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
    Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
    then, peace be with him.

    


    He is in earnest.


    In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
    the love of Beatrice.


    And hath challenged thee.


    Most sincerely.


    What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
    doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!


    He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
    doctor to such a man.


    But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
    be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?



    Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
    shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
    an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.


    How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
    one!


    Hearken after their offence, my lord.


    Officers, what offence have these men done?


    Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
    moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
    they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
    belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
    things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.


    First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
    ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
    they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
    to their charge.


    Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
    my troth, there's one meaning well suited.


    Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
    bound to your answer? this learned constable is
    too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?


    Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
    do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
    deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
    could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
    to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
    to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
    to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
    the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
    garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
    marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
    I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
    to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
    master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
    nothing but the reward of a villain.


    Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?


    I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.


    But did my brother set thee on to this?


    Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.


    He is composed and framed of treachery:
    And fled he is upon this villany.


    Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
    In the rare semblance that I loved it first.


    Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
    sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
    and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
    and place shall serve, that I am an ass.


    Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
    Sexton too.

    Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton


    Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
    That, when I note another man like him,
    I may avoid him: which of these is he?


    If you would know your wronger, look on me.


    Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
    Mine innocent child?


    Yea, even I alone.


    No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
    Here stand a pair of honourable men;
    A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
    I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
    Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
    'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.


    I know not how to pray your patience;
    Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
    Impose me to what penance your invention
    Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
    But in mistaking.


    By my soul, nor I:
    And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
    I would bend under any heavy weight
    That he'll enjoin me to.


    I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
    That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
    Possess the people in Messina here
    How innocent she died; and if your love
    Can labour ought in sad invention,
    Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
    And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
    To-morrow morning come you to my house,
    And since you could not be my son-in-law,
    Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
    Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
    And she alone is heir to both of us:
    Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
    And so dies my revenge.


    O noble sir,
    Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
    I do embrace your offer; and dispose
    For henceforth of poor Claudio.


    To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
    To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
    Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
    Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
    Hired to it by your brother.


    No, by my soul, she was not,
    Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
    But always hath been just and virtuous
    In any thing that I do know by her.


    Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
    black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
    me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
    punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
    one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
    a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
    name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
    that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
    for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.


    I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.


    Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
    reverend youth; and I praise God for you.


    There's for thy pains.


    God save the foundation!


    Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.


    I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
    beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
    example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
    your worship well; God restore you to health! I
    humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
    meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

    Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES


    Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.


    Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.


    We will not fail.


    To-night I'll mourn with Hero.


    [To the Watch] Bring you these fellows on. We'll
    talk with Margaret,
    How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.

    Exeunt, severally




    Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
    my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.


    Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?


    In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
    shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
    deservest it.


    To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
    keep below stairs?


    Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.


    And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
    but hurt not.


    A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
    woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
    thee the bucklers.


    Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.


    If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
    pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.


    Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.


    And therefore will come.

     MARGARET

    Sings

    The god of love,
    That sits above,
    And knows me, and knows me,
    How pitiful I deserve,--
    I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
    swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
    a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
    whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
    blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
    over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
    cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
    out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
    rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
    'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
    endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
    nor I cannot woo in festival terms.


    Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?


    Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.


    O, stay but till then!


    'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
    I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
    knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.


    Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.


    Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
    foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
    will depart unkissed.


    Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
    so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
    plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
    I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
    him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
    which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?


    For them all together; which maintained so politic
    a state of evil that they will not admit any good
    part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
    good parts did you first suffer love for me?


    Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
    indeed, for I love thee against my will.


    In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
    If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
    yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.


    Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.


    It appears not in this confession: there's not one
    wise man among twenty that will praise himself.


    An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
    the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
    in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
    no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
    widow weeps.


    And how long is that, think you?


    Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
    rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
    wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
    impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
    own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
    praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
    praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?


    Very ill.


    And how do you?


    Very ill too.


    Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
    you too, for here comes one in haste.



    Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
    coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
    falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
    abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
    fed and gone. Will you come presently?


    Will you go hear this news, signior?


    I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
    buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
    thee to thy uncle's.

    Exeunt




    Is this the monument of Leonato?


    It is, my lord.


    [Reading out of a scroll]
    Done to death by slanderous tongues
    Was the Hero that here lies:
    Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
    Gives her fame which never dies.
    So the life that died with shame
    Lives in death with glorious fame.
    Hang thou there upon the tomb,
    Praising her when I am dumb.
    Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
    SONG.
    Pardon, goddess of the night,
    Those that slew thy virgin knight;
    For the which, with songs of woe,
    Round about her tomb they go.
    Midnight, assist our moan;
    Help us to sigh and groan,
    Heavily, heavily:
    Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
    Till death be uttered,
    Heavily, heavily.


    Now, unto thy bones good night!
    Yearly will I do this rite.


    Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
    The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
    Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
    Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
    Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.


    Good morrow, masters: each his several way.


    Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
    And then to Leonato's we will go.


    And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
    Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.

    Exeunt




    Did I not tell you she was innocent?


    So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
    Upon the error that you heard debated:
    But Margaret was in some fault for this,
    Although against her will, as it appears
    In the true course of all the question.


    Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.


    And so am I, being else by faith enforced
    To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.


    Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
    Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
    And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.

    Exeunt Ladies

    The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
    To visit me. You know your office, brother:
    You must be father to your brother's daughter
    And give her to young Claudio.


    Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.


    Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.


    To do what, signior?


    To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
    Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
    Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.


    That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.


    And I do with an eye of love requite her.


    The sight whereof I think you had from me,
    From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?


    Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
    But, for my will, my will is your good will
    May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
    In the state of honourable marriage:
    In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.


    My heart is with your liking.


    And my help.
    Here comes the prince and Claudio.



    Good morrow to this fair assembly.


    Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
    We here attend you. Are you yet determined
    To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?


    I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.


    Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.

     ANTONIO


    Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
    That you have such a February face,
    So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?


    I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
    Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
    And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
    As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
    When he would play the noble beast in love.


    Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
    And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
    And got a calf in that same noble feat
    Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.


    For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.

    Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked

    Which is the lady I must seize upon?


    This same is she, and I do give you her.


    Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.


    No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
    Before this friar and swear to marry her.


    Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
    I am your husband, if you like of me.


    And when I lived, I was your other wife:

    Unmasking

    And when you loved, you were my other husband.


    Another Hero!


    Nothing certainer:
    One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
    And surely as I live, I am a maid.


    The former Hero! Hero that is dead!


    She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.


    All this amazement can I qualify:
    When after that the holy rites are ended,
    I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
    Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
    And to the chapel let us presently.


    Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?


    [Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?


    Do not you love me?


    Why, no; no more than reason.


    Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
    Have been deceived; they swore you did.


    Do not you love me?


    Troth, no; no more than reason.


    Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
    Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.


    They swore that you were almost sick for me.


    They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.


    'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?


    No, truly, but in friendly recompense.


    Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.


    And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
    For here's a paper written in his hand,
    A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
    Fashion'd to Beatrice.


    And here's another
    Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
    Containing her affection unto Benedick.


    A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
    Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
    thee for pity.


    I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
    upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
    for I was told you were in a consumption.


    Peace! I will stop your mouth.

    Kissing her


    How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?


    I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
    wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
    thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
    if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
    nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
    purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
    purpose that the world can say against it; and
    therefore never flout at me for what I have said
    against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
    conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
    have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
    kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.


    I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
    that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
    life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
    question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
    exceedingly narrowly to thee.


    Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
    we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
    and our wives' heels.


    We'll have dancing afterward.


    First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
    thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
    there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.



    My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
    And brought with armed men back to Messina.


    Think not on him till to-morrow:
    I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
    Strike up, pipers.
